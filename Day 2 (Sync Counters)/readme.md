# Day 2 – Counters

## Overview
This day focuses on designing and verifying synchronous counters using Verilog.
Multiple counter variants were implemented to understand reset behavior,
enable gating, wrap logic, and parameterization.

## Implemented Blocks
- Synchronous up counter
- MOD-5 counter with controlled wrap
- Synchronous down counter
- Up/down counter with direction control

## Key Learnings
- Difference between enable and reset
- Controlled vs natural wrap-around
- Importance of parameterized RTL
- Writing clean, self-checking testbenches
